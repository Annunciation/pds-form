Your client would like to have the feature that allows a family to register online at their organization.
PDS Church Office generates the FamilyRegistrationForm.html, RegCSS.cs, and RegJS.js files for you to use
on your client's website.


When a family submits their information on the online form, two emails will be sent automatically - one will be
sent to the parish's email account as the notification, and one will be sent to the family as the confirmation
that their registration was sent to the parish. The family's registration data will be stored on our server, and
the parish can add it into their church database from there.




Thank you,
R&D at Parish Data System
